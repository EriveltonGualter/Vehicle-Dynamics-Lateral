%% Description
% The center of gravity of the vehicle is located at the point $T$. The front and rear axles are located ate the points $F$ and $R$, respectively. The constant $a$ measures the distance of point $F$ to $T$ and $b$ the distance of point $T$ to $R$. The angles $\alpha_F$ e $\alpha_R$ are the front and rear slip angles, respectively. $\alpha_T$ is the vehicle side slip angle and $\psi$ is the vehicle yaw angle. $\delta$ is the steering angle.
